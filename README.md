# Ontology-Based Cost Management for Infrastructure Projects  
## Case Study: German Railway Infrastructure

This repository contains the datasets used in the EC3 2026 research paper:

**Ontology-Based Cost Management Transferability in Infrastructure Projects:  
A Case Study on German Railway Infrastructure**

The project investigates the **transferability, applicability, scalability, and generalizability** of an existing ontology-based cost management approach—originally developed for building projects—when applied to **infrastructure projects** within a **different national regulatory framework**.

The study focuses on **German railway infrastructure projects**, characterized by domain-specific standards, regulations, and cost management rules.

## Research Objectives

The main objectives of this research are to:

- Assess the **transferability** of an ontology-based cost management model across construction domains (from buildings to infrastructure)
- Evaluate its **applicability** within the German public infrastructure regulatory framework
- Test its **scalability** across standardized small-scale infrastructure projects
- Demonstrate how ontology-based cost structures support **lifecycle-oriented cost development** and **semantic consistency**


## Methodological Background

The research builds on the ontology-based cost management approach proposed by **Cassandro et al. (2025)** DOI:[10.35490/EC3.2025.263](https://doi.org/10.35490/EC3.2025.263), with a strong emphasis on:

- Reuse of existing ontologies rather than developing isolated models
- Semantic structuring of cost items and technical descriptions
- Integration of cost information across project phases and lifecycle processes

The approach does **not aim to standardize prices**, but rather to semantically structure cost item descriptions in order to enable consistent association, comparison, and updating of cost values across projects and national contexts.


## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- Cost item datasets used in the German railway case study  
- Structured cost descriptions aligned with ontology-based concepts  
- Mappings between cost items and project lifecycle phases  
- Supporting documentation describing data structure and assumptions  

> **Note:** Unit prices are highly context-dependent and may not be directly reusable outside the original project conditions.


## Data Scope and Limitations

- The datasets refer to **standardized small-scale railway infrastructure projects**
- Data is provided **for research and validation purposes only**
- Cost structures and classifications follow **German railway infrastructure regulations**
- The repository does **not provide benchmark prices or commercial cost data**


## Reuse and Transferability

The datasets are intended to support:

- Validation of ontology-based cost management approaches
- Comparative studies across construction domains or national contexts
- Further research on semantic cost modeling and BIM-based cost integration

Users are encouraged to reuse the **semantic structure** rather than the numerical cost values when applying the data to different regulatory or project environments.
